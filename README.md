# 465 Full Stack Web Application

## Overview
Travlr is a full-stack travel booking application built using the MEAN architecture (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js). It features a structured separation of concerns between the client, server, and database, and demonstrates CRUD operations, RESTful API development, authentication, routing, and SPA (Single Page Application) design.

This project was developed as part of CS-465: Full-Stack Development, with emphasis on building secure, scalable, and maintainable applications using modern web technologies.

The system follows a three-tier architecture: Client - Server - Database. Each layer contains its own sub-components for UI, routing, controllers, and data access. 

## Features
- CRUD operations for managing travel trips
- Admin dashboard built with Angular
- Customer-facing site built with Express
- RESTful API with secure JWT authentication
- MongoDB integration using Mongoose
- SPA navigation with no full page reloads
